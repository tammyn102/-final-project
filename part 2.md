## Sets

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Sets characteristics 

- Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

- A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.

- Sets are written with curly brackets.

`thisset = {"Charizard", "Vulpix", "Entei"}`

`print(thisset)`
 
Now we have created a set of fire type pokemons!!!

# Facts about Sets 

- Unordered means that the items in the set don't have a specify order
- Unchangeabke means that we cannot change the order after the set has been created. 
- Duplicates are not allowed. Sets cannot have two indentical values.

`thisset = {"Charizard", "Vulpix", "Entei", "Vulpix"}`

`print(thisset)`

The output will delete the duplicate it item.
